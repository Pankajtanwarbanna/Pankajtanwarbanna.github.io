                <b> • NPM </b>
                <br>
                NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a default package manager for Nodejs. It consists of a CLI & an online database of packages (npm registry).
                <br><br>
                <b> • YARN </b>
                <br>
                YARN stands for Yet another Resource Negotiator. It is similer to npm, open source, developed by Facebook to overcome the shortcomings of NPM and fix performance + security issues. Yarn isn’t technically a replacement for npm since it relies on modules from the npm registry.
                <br><br>
                Comparing NPM & YARN -
                <br><br>
                <b>1. Performance :</b>
                <br>
                A test was performed to compare the speed of installing under different conditions.
                <br><br>

                <ul class="resume-item-list">
                    <li>YARN parallelizes packages installation operation so installs are faster (compared to npm). Yarn installs multiple packages at once and npm only one at once.</li>
                    <li>YARN has offline download feature so reinstallations are extremly fast. (npm also support cache feature but yarn is far much better)</li>
                </ul> 

                <b>2. Security :</b>
                <br>
                Yarn uses a checksum to verify the integrity of packages installed before any code is executed. What is a checksum? A checksum basically is a string of characters created by applying a mathematical algorithm to the contents of a file. It is used to check whether or not two files are the same. How does it work? Anytime a package is installed and is about to be executed, an integrity check is done by using the package’s checksum. 
                <br><br>
                NPM, on the other hand, performs integrity checks via SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) specified in the package-lock.json file. An SHA-1 string is appended on each package block in the package-lock.json and integrity check is performed using the integrity key.
